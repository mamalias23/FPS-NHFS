			<p>
				A full & finals solutions is a negotiation of a lump sum available to clear outstanding debts at a reduced amount. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So this could occur when a client comes into some money and uses that money to repay debts owed. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If the lump sum does not cover all the debts in total & here at NHFS we will try and negotiate with 
				the creditors a final settlement payment based around the lump sum amount. 
				If this is accepted by the creditor the remaining amount would be written off.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The creditors are not obliged to accept the full and final part payment of the debt, due to this a full 
				breakdown of the client income and expenditure would be shown as if the client is of limited means 
				and the creditor can see that there is little chance of recovering any more of the debt by any other 
				repayment methods they are more likely to accept.   
			</p>

			<h4>Full & Final Settlements â€“ things to consider:</h4>
			<ul class="custom">
				<li>If you come into a lump sum of money, you may wish to put this toward part 
					payment of your debts. If your creditors agree to this single payment in return for 
					writing off any remaining balance, then this is known as a full and final settlement 
					and you owe them nothing more
				</li>
				<li>Creditors may only agree to this if you have limited means with which to repay any remaining balance</li>
				<li>Your credit rating may still be affected, unless your creditor(s) amend their records 
					to confirm that you have repaid all the money they require from you. You can ask 
					them to do this, but they are not legally obliged to do so
				</li>
			</ul>
