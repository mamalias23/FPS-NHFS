			<p>
				A Trust Deed in Scotland is a voluntary agreement between a debtor and the creditors. It is 
				one of the options that can be used when debt repayments are no longer affordable. 
				Thousands of people each year choose to sign Scottish trust deeds to deal with serious debt 
				difficulties.
			</p>
			<p>
				In simple terms, a trust deed is a compromise between a debtor (who cannot afford to fully 
				repay their debts) and the creditors (who would like to recover at least some of what is 
				owed to them). It is an alternative to bankruptcy. 
				Scottish trust deeds can be a highly effective debt solution and are used with success by 
				thousands of people around Scotland each year. They should however be viewed as a last 
				resort, or an alternative to bankruptcy, when personal debt problems have become very 
				serious.
			</p>
			<h3>Advantages of a Trust Deed:</h3>
			<ul class="custom">
				<li>All Interest & Charges on the debts owed will be frozen from the date the Trust Deed is signed.</li>
				<li>As soon as the Trust Deed is given the protected status no further action can be taken by the creditors. I.E. CCJ’s</li>
				<li>Single payment each month during the term of the Trust Deed. </li>
				<li>After paying the Trust Deed for the term agreed (usually 48 months) any remaining debt will be written off. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Potential Disadvantages of a Trust Deed:</h3>
			<ul class="custom">
				<li>
					If it is possible to obtain an increased mortgage during a trust deed, homeowners 
					with equity may be required to do so in order to release money to help repay their 
					creditors. A mortgage obtained during a trust deed is likely to be on less favourable 
					terms than might otherwise be achieved (for example the interest rates may be 
					higher). If a homeowner with equity is unable to re-mortgage during their trust deed, 
					and the money cannot be raised by other means, their home may be at risk of being 
					sold to release the equity. 
				</li>
				<li>Your expenditure during a protected trust deed will be restricted in order that you 
					can pay what it is deemed that you can reasonably afford towards your debts. Only 
					unsecured debts included in a trust deed will be written off at the end of the 
					process. 
				</li>
				<li>Scottish Trust Deeds also have a very significant effect on a credit record which is likely to be similar to bankruptcy. </li>
				<li>You cannot acquire further credit over the amount of £250.00 until discharged from the trust deed </li>
				<li>You cannot be a Director of a Limited Company. </li>
