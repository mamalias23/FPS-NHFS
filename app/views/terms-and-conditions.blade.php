					<ul>
						<li>any funds We have received through electronic transfer into our bank account or (as the case may be) our client trust account with 
						our bank (for example, standing order or debit card payments) which We know came from You and which have not been returned 
						unpaid;</li>
						<li>any cash, postal order or banker’s draft made payable to Us or to our client trust account that We have received from You and 
						which We know came from You; or</li>

						notice from our bank that the cheque has been returned unpaid within 10 days. 
						‘Disposable income’ means the amount of money You have available to repay to your Lenders each month having taken account of

					how the fees are calculated.</p>
					<p>‘Initial Fee’ means the payment you make to us in order that we can begin negotiations with Your Creditors for a monthly Payment
					Plan (or Debt Management Plan). This fee is calculated from the financial information that you provide to Us during the application 
					process and is equivalent to two times Your Monthly Fee. This fee is used to cover Our initial costs in collecting and reviewing Your 
					documentation, negotiating with Your Creditors, and setting up Your monthly Payment Plan or Debt Management Plan.</p>
					<p>‘Monthly Fee’ means the monthly charge for our services. This is dependant of how many creditors you have on the plan. This 
					charge only commences after the initial fee has been paid the monthly fee is charged as follows: </p>
					<p>Up to 3 creditors = £25.00<br>
					4-6 Creditors = £30.00<br>

					10+ Creditors = £40.00<br>
					</p>
					<p>‘Monthly Payment Plan’ means the payment that You are required to make to Us each month as set out in, and in accordance with, 
					the monthly Payment Plan.</p>
					<p>‘Payment Plan’ (or Debt Management Plan) means the schedule of payments that You are required to make under this agreement 
					in order to repay Your creditors and pay for Our services. Your Payment Plan is created by Us and is based on the information 
					provided by You.</p>
					<p>‘Total fees’ means an estimate of the Total fees You will pay to Us during the Period. We work out the Total fees by multiplying the 
					Service fee by the number of months in the Period and adding the Set-up fee. It is important You understand that the Total fees are 
					an estimate. You will find details about the Total fees in the Information Pack and the Fee Schedule. </p>
